# Module 6 — Operational Intelligence and Conversational Observability

## What You Will Build

A two-phase conversational ops agent that can answer natural-language questions about platform health:

1. **`observability_mock.py`** — a local HTTP server that simulates a real observability platform (think Datadog/Prometheus). Serves realistic platform health data across four endpoints.
2. **`conversational_agent.py`** — a two-phase agent: Phase 1 routes the question (incident / investigation / health check), Phase 2 fetches live data from the mock server and produces a structured diagnosis with a causal chain.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `observability_mock.py` | **Local mock observability server** — start this first |
| `conversational_agent.py` | **Exercise file** — implement `phase1_route()` and `phase2_analyse()` |
| `agent.py` | Simplified REPL alternative |
| `sample_data.json` | Static snapshot of platform health data |
| `agent-config.yml` | Model and output schema |
| `solutions/solution.py` | **Reference implementation** — read this only after your own attempt |

---

## Setup

```bash
# From the repo root
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
python module1/verify_setup.py
```

---

## Run (Two-Terminal Workflow)

**Terminal 1 — start the mock server:**

```bash
# Normal scenario (all services healthy):
python module6/observability_mock.py

# Active incident scenario (OOMKill in checkout-service):
python module6/observability_mock.py --scenario incident

# High-load scenario:
python module6/observability_mock.py --scenario high-load
```

**Terminal 2 — run the conversational agent:**

```bash
# Mock mode (no server or API key needed):
python module6/conversational_agent.py --query "What's wrong?" --mock

# Live call against the mock server:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module6/conversational_agent.py --query "We are getting paged. What is causing the latency spike?"

# Interactive REPL (keeps asking questions):
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module6/agent.py
```

## Mock Server Endpoints

| Endpoint | Returns |
|----------|---------|
| `GET /health` | Per-service health status (UP / DEGRADED / DOWN) |
| `GET /metrics` | Error rates, latency, throughput, memory usage |
| `GET /anomalies` | Detected anomalies with severity and correlation chain |
| `GET /events` | Recent deployment and config-change events |

---

## Expected Output

```json
{
  "query":             "We are getting paged. What is causing the latency spike?",
  "query_type":        "incident",
  "status_summary":    "ACTIVE INCIDENT — checkout-service DOWN due to OOMKill cascading to payment-service and api-gateway.",
  "narrative":         "checkout-service v1.9.0 introduced a cache warm-up loading 250k records on startup. Memory peaked at 1.1Gi against a 512Mi limit, triggering an OOMKill. The pod restart loop is causing 503s that have cascaded to payment-service and tripped the api-gateway circuit breaker on /checkout/**.",
  "causal_chain": [
    "deploy v1.9.0 introduced cache warm-up loading 250k records on startup",
    "startup memory spike: 1.1Gi peak vs 512Mi limit",
    "OOM killer terminates process → pod restart loop → sustained 503s",
    "payment-service error rate rises to 8.7% from checkout dependency failures",
    "api-gateway circuit breaker opens on /checkout/** → all checkout traffic blocked"
  ],
  "confidence":         "HIGH",
  "recommended_action": "Immediate: roll back checkout-service to v1.8.x. Increase memory limit to 2Gi before re-deploying v1.9.0. Page on-call — P1 incident.",
  "deploy_safe":        false,
  "escalate":           true
}
```

Full result saved to `output/output_module6.json`.

## Exercise

Open `conversational_agent.py`. The file is fully implemented — `phase1_route()` and `phase2_analyse()` are already complete. Study both functions carefully:

**`phase1_route(query)`** — classifies the query using `ROUTING_SYSTEM_PROMPT` (64 tokens max). Notice that it uses `max_tokens=64` — classification needs no generation. The return value is `result.get("query_type", "health_check")` with a safe default.

**`phase2_analyse(query, query_type, platform_data)`** — builds a combined `user_msg` from the query, the type, and the full platform data snapshot, then calls `ask()` with `ANALYSIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT`. Both system prompts are defined in the file — read them before running.

```bash
python module6/conversational_agent.py --query "What's wrong?" --mock
python module6/conversational_agent.py --query "Is it safe to deploy?" --mock
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module6/conversational_agent.py --query "We are getting paged. What is causing the latency spike?"
```

After running, compare your understanding of the implementation against `solutions/solution.py` — the solution file isolates and annotates the two key functions with inline comments explaining each design decision.

## Troubleshooting

**`ConnectionRefusedError: [Errno 111]`** — The mock server isn't running. Start `observability_mock.py` in a separate terminal first.

**`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'observability_mock'`** — Run from the repo root: `python module6/conversational_agent.py`, not `cd module6 && python conversational_agent.py`.

---

## Key Takeaway

Phase 1 routing is cheap on purpose. Classifying the question first — before fetching any data — means you only pull the observability signals that are actually relevant to the question type. An incident query needs anomalies and events; a health check only needs `/health`. Without routing, the agent would over-fetch on every query and send irrelevant data to Claude, increasing token cost and degrading reasoning quality. The two-phase pattern scales: adding a new question type means adding a new route and a new data-fetch strategy — not rewriting the agent. This is the same pattern used in production AIOps systems.

## GitHub Actions

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/module6-conv-ops.yml`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow name | `Module 6 — Conversational Ops` |
| Trigger | Push to `module6/**` or `shared/**`, or manual via Actions tab |
| Script run | `python module6/agent.py` |
| Output artifact | `module6-output` → `output/output_module6.json` |

The workflow runs `agent.py` (the simplified REPL alternative) rather than `conversational_agent.py`. In CI there is no interactive terminal, so the REPL script runs a single preconfigured query against `sample_data.json` — no live mock server is needed.

When you run `conversational_agent.py` locally with the two-terminal setup, you are adding the live mock server to the loop. The GitHub Actions run shows you the same structured JSON output but using the static snapshot, which is reproducible and does not depend on a running server.

**Prerequisite:** Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret).

## Success Criteria

- Mock server starts and responds to all four endpoints
- `conversational_agent.py --mock` runs cleanly without a server or API key
- Agent correctly routes the query (incident / investigation / health_check) in Phase 1
- Response contains `status_summary`, `narrative`, `causal_chain` (list), `confidence`, `recommended_action`, `deploy_safe`, and `escalate`
- Full output saved to `output/output_module6.json`
- GitHub Actions workflow completes and `module6-output` artifact is attached to the run
- If stuck, see `solutions/solution.py`
