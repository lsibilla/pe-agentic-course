# Module 5 — Intelligent CI/CD and Adaptive Delivery

## What You Will Build

A two-agent CI/CD quality gate system:

1. **`triage_agent.py`** (blocking gate) — runs *before* deploy, evaluates the release candidate against six configurable thresholds in `quality-gates.json`, and returns `APPROVE`, `APPROVE_WITH_CONDITIONS`, or `HOLD`.
2. **`monitor.py`** (post-deploy watchdog) — runs *after* deploy on a timed check, evaluates live production signals, and decides whether to recommend an immediate rollback.

This is deliberate separation of concerns: the gate prevents bad deploys; the monitor catches what slips through.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `triage_agent.py` | **Demo file** — fully implemented pre-deploy quality gate agent |
| `monitor.py` | **Demo file** — fully implemented post-deploy monitor agent |
| `quality-gates.json` | Threshold configuration (edit this to change gate behaviour) |
| `sample_data.json` | Sample pipeline results (agent input for both scripts) |
| `agent-config.yml` | Model and output schema |
| `solutions/solution.py` | **Reference implementation** — read this only after your own attempt |

---

## Setup

```bash
# From the repo root
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key_here
python module1/verify_setup.py
```

---

## Run the Quality Gate Agent

```bash
# Mock mode — see expected output shape:
python module5/triage_agent.py --mock

# Live call (evaluates sample_data.json against quality-gates.json):
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module5/triage_agent.py
```

## Run the Post-Deploy Monitor

```bash
# Mock mode:
python module5/monitor.py --mock

# Live call:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module5/monitor.py
```

## Quality Gates (from quality-gates.json)

| Gate | Metric | Threshold | Blocks Deploy? |
|------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Unit Test Coverage | `coverage_pct` | ≥ 95% | No |
| Branch Coverage | `coverage_branch_pct` | ≥ 80% | No |
| SAST High Findings | `security_scan.high` | = 0 | **Yes** |
| Lighthouse Score | `lighthouse_score` | ≥ 85 | No |
| P95 Latency Delta | `latency_p95_delta_pct` | ≤ 10% | **Yes** |
| Cost Per Request Delta | `cost_per_request_delta_pct` | ≤ 10% | No |

Edit `quality-gates.json` to adjust thresholds without changing any code.

## Expected Output (Quality Gate — borderline case)

```json
{
  "decision": "APPROVE_WITH_CONDITIONS",
  "confidence": "HIGH",
  "rationale": "All critical gates pass. Coverage 74.1% is below threshold but has not regressed. Friday deploy window elevates risk.",
  "blocking_issues": [],
  "conditions": [
    "Coverage must not regress below 74% in the next three PRs",
    "Deploy should target off-peak hours (before 14:00 UTC)"
  ],
  "risk_score": "MEDIUM",
  "recommended_deploy_window": "Before 14:00 UTC today or defer to Monday",
  "escalate": false
}
```

Full result saved to `output/output_module5.json`.

## Exercise

**Part A — Read and run the quality gate:** `triage_agent.py` is fully implemented — both the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` and `run_agent()` are complete. Study the implementation before running it: read `SYSTEM_PROMPT` to understand the gate criteria, then trace how `run_agent()` loads `sample_data.json`, calls `ask()`, and prints the structured decision.

```bash
python module5/triage_agent.py --mock                     # shows expected output shape
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-... python module5/triage_agent.py   # live run against Claude
```

**Part B — Threshold experiment:** Edit `quality-gates.json` — lower the `threshold` for `test_coverage` from 95 to 70. Re-run `triage_agent.py` and observe how the gate decision changes. No code edit required, only the config file. This demonstrates the architecture: the agent reads thresholds as data, not as hardcoded logic.

See `solutions/solution.py` for a version with an extended six-dimension gate including a Change Risk dimension not present in the base implementation.

## Key Takeaway

The gate and the monitor are intentionally two separate agents with two separate failure modes. The gate is **preventive** — it blocks a bad deploy before it reaches production. The monitor is **reactive** — it catches the failures that slip through. A single agent trying to do both jobs would conflate pre-deploy reasoning (static analysis of pipeline results) with post-deploy reasoning (live production signals). Keeping them separate also means you can tune each agent's confidence threshold and system prompt independently. The monitor's `rollback_recommended` decision is a different kind of judgment than the gate's `decision` — one is about risk, the other is about live impact.

## GitHub Actions

**Workflow file:** `.github/workflows/module5-quality-gate.yml`

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Workflow name | `Module 5 — Quality Gate` |
| Trigger | Push to `module5/**` or `shared/**`, or manual via Actions tab |
| Script run | `python module5/triage_agent.py` |
| Output artifact | `module5-output` → `output/output_module5.json` |

The workflow runs the quality gate agent automatically on every push to `module5/` or `shared/`. This mirrors how a real pre-deploy gate works: any change to the agent or its config triggers a fresh evaluation against the pipeline results in `sample_data.json`.

Note that `monitor.py` (the post-deploy watchdog) is not included in this workflow — it is designed to run on a timed schedule or post-deploy hook, not on code push. Run it locally to see the rollback decision.

**Prerequisite:** Add your API key as a repository secret named `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret).

## Success Criteria

- `triage_agent.py --mock` runs cleanly and shows expected output shape
- Live run returns `decision` of APPROVE, APPROVE_WITH_CONDITIONS, or HOLD
- `monitor.py` returns `rollback_recommended` (boolean) with a `severity`
- Editing `quality-gates.json` changes the gate decision without code changes
- Full output saved to `output/output_module5.json`
- GitHub Actions workflow completes and `module5-output` artifact is attached to the run
- If stuck, see `solutions/solution.py`
